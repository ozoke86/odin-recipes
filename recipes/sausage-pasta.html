    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces penne pasta</li>
      <li>2 Italian chicken sausages</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, finely minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>12 ounces marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add pasta, and cook until
        tender with a bite, 9 to 11 minutes, or according to package directions.
        Reserve about 1/4 cup pasta water; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, slice chicken sausages in half, then slice each half into
        small bite-sized pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and add sausage. Cook and stir
        until sausage is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Scrape up any browned
        bits from the bottom of the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add butter and garlic to the skillet; cook until garlic is fragrant,
        about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add marinara sauce and cream to the skillet. Cook until combined and
        completely warmed through; stir in pasta. If saice is too thick, thin
        with a little pasta water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat and add in as much Parmesan as you like. Serve in deep
        bowls with bread to scoop up the extra sauce.
      </li>
