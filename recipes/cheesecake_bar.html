    <h2>Description</h2>
    For these Nutella swirl cheesecake bars, a rich Nutella-swirled cheesecake filling sits atop an
    <br />OREO and hazelnut-studded crust for a truly delectable dessert. Make sure to give the bars
    at <br />least 4 hours in the fridge before serving.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Crust</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 1/2 cups finely ground chocolate creme filled sandwich cookie crumbs (such as OREO®)<br />,
        from about 19 cookies
      </li>
      <li>1/3 cup chopped dry-roasted hazelnuts</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>16 ounces full-fat cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>3/4 cup heavy cream, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 extra large egg, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chocolate hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a 9x9-inch square pan with enough
        <br />parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine OREO crumbs, chopped hazelnuts, brown sugar, and pinch of salt in a food processor;
        <br />pulse until finely ground. Add in melted butter and pulse until mixture is evenly
        moistened. <br />
        Pour mixture into the prepared pan and press firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and allow crust to cool
        <br />for 10 minutes. Keep the oven on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat cream cheese, white sugar, vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg together in a large
        <br />bowl with an electric mixer until completely smooth and combined. Add in heavy cream
        and <br />lemon juice and beat until smooth and combined. Add in egg and mix until just
        incorporated. <br />Pour batter over crust and spread into an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place Nutella in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until slightly warmed, about 30
        <br />seconds. Place dollops of warm Nutella randomly over cheesecake filling. Use a sharp
        knife <br />to gently swirl the batters together, taking care not to go too deep and cut the
        crust. Tap <br />the pan on the counter a few times to help the batter to settle again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake bars in the preheated oven until edges of bars begin to turn golden, and bars still
        <br />have a slight jiggle in the center, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow bars to cool to room
        <br />temperature; then refrigerate until fully chilled, at least 4 hours. Cut into 16 bars.
      </li>
    </ol>
